      <p>
      <h2>All rules mentioned below apply to both text and voice channels, If you find anyone breaking a rule, then please report them with evidence in #report</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>1. Be respectful to everyone</h4>
      This is a simple rule to follow, and all it means is that you are to treat everyone as equals. (This does NOT mean you can't debate about things. We encourage people to share their opinions, just make sure it's done in a respectful way.)
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>2. Do not use vulgar language or constantly use swear words</h4>
      Simply do not use vulgar language at all. Swearing is okay if it's done every once and a while, but don't be using it every 10 messages.
      Vulgar language includes the following: Speaking of blood or gore in detail. Talking about things people may find gross in great detail. words such as the N-word.
      Swearing includes the following: F-word, S-word, A-word ect... (the word Hell does not count as swearing if it's being used in a non-threatening way, and if it's being used in the context of the place.)
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>3. Don't discriminate against others</h4>
      Similar to rule number 1, in that we are asking you treat everyone equally. We ask that you are not racist, sexist, or anything along those lines.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>4. Do not advertise unless it's in #advertising (This includes DM advertising)</h4>
      Pretty self-explanatory; Don't advertise links, discords, or social media anywhere that isn't #advertising, and do not do this is DMs either. If you find someone from the server DM advertising to you, please report it in #report, and we'll look into it further.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>5. Do not post inappropriate links/photos</h4>
      Don't post links/photos of NSFW content, or photos/links that contradict the server rules. We also do not want any explicit content posted.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>6. Do not spam CAPS, Emojis or words</h4>
      Spamming means saying the same thing 3+ times in a row, or saying nonsense 3+ times in a row. copypasta falls under this and will be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>7. Only do things in the designed categories (e.g. don't do commands in #general-chat do it in #commands)</h4>
      Extremely self-explanatory. Just do stuff in their designed catagories.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>8. Do not mass mention/mass ping anyone</h4>
      Don't @ people more than once in the spam of 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>9. Don't mention/ping anyone without reason</h4>
      Don't @ people without a good reason. (Doing it to annoy them is deffinatly not a good reason)
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>10. Don't share private imformation</h4>
      Don't share your (or anyone else's) private information such as; address, IP, credit card information, etc... We want people to stay safe.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>11. Listen to the staff team, and do what they say (Unless they are abusing, which is that case report it to a Co-Owner or above)</h4>
      Treat Staff and Senior Staff with respect
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>12. Do not use voice changers in voice channels</h4>
      Voice changers can really annoy some people, so we just don't want people using them.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>13. Don't ear-rape people in voice channels</h4>
      Please don't play or do anything that will hurt anyone elses' ears. We don't want anyone going deaf because someone thought it would be funny to scream into their microphone
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>14. Do not post innapropriate or harmful emojis/images</h4>
      We do not want someone to be offended by an image or even harmed. This especially applies to emojis/images that could cause an epileptic seizure or are NSFW.
      </p>
